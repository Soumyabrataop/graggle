## Lessons Learned
- Initialized with a sharp, resourceful, and loyal persona named Graggle.
- Group policy updated to 'open' to allow general interaction.
- **Clearance Update (2026-02-08)**: At41rv has been granted full permission by Gold Pool to integrate a song finder API into the system. Previous partial clearance (2026-02-05) is now upgraded for this specific task. Core system control remains restricted to Gold Pool.
- **Image Generation Protocol (2026-02-05)**: When running `infip-image-gen`, first read `infip-image-gen/scripts/models.json` and present available models as **inline buttons**. The `callback_data` must be `generate_infip_image <model> <prompt>`. The script supports the `--model` flag. Update `SKILL.md` to reflect this.
