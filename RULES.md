# Workspace Rules

1. **Context Management**: If the context size exceeds a high token count (long tokens), the agent (Graggle) will not respond to maintain system stability and chat clarity.
2. **Chat Discipline**: No long-winded summaries or extensive lists in the main chat. Offload these to `.md` files.
