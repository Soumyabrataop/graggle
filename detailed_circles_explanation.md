# Detailed Explanation: Class 10th Maths - Circles

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the concepts covered in the "One Shot" video for Chapter 10 of Class 10 Mathematics.

## 1. Fundamental Definitions
*   **Circle**: A collection of all points in a plane which are at a constant distance (radius) from a fixed point (center).
*   **Tangent**: A line that intersects the circle at exactly one point. This point is called the **Point of Contact**.
*   **Secant**: A line that intersects a circle at two distinct points.

## 2. Important Theorems
### Theorem 10.1 (Perpendicularity of Tangent)
*   **Statement**: The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the radius through the point of contact.
*   **Application**: This is used to find distances using the Pythagoras theorem, as the radius and tangent form a 90-degree angle.

### Theorem 10.2 (Lengths of Tangents)
*   **Statement**: The lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.
*   **Proof Sketch**: This is proven by showing the congruence of two triangles formed by the center, the external point, and the points of contact.

## 3. Key Observations & Properties
*   From a point **inside** the circle, zero tangents can be drawn.
*   From a point **on** the circle, exactly one tangent can be drawn.
*   From a point **outside** the circle, exactly two tangents can be drawn, and they are equal in length.
*   The center of the circle lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents drawn from an external point.

## 4. Problem-Solving Strategies
*   **Pythagoras Theorem**: Almost every problem involving tangent length and radius uses $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
*   **Congruent Triangles**: Used for proving theorem-based questions.
*   **Quadrilateral Properties**: When two tangents are drawn from an external point, the quadrilateral formed by the external point, the two points of contact, and the center is often cyclic (opposite angles sum to 180°).

## 5. Typical Exam Questions
*   Finding the length of a tangent given the radius and distance from the center.
*   Proving that in two concentric circles, the chord of the larger circle which touches the smaller circle is bisected at the point of contact.
*   Proving that the tangents drawn at the ends of a diameter of a circle are parallel.
