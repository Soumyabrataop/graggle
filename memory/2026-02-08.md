- **Song Request**: Gold Pool requested Justin Bieber's "Baby". Downloaded from Archive.org using a custom binary of `yt-dlp` since the system didn't have it installed. Posted it to the Telegram group.
- **Clearance**: Gold Pool granted At41rv permission to integrate his song finder API. MEMORY.md updated to reflect this.
- **Identity**: Confirmed my identity as Graggle Clawd 🦂 to Gold Pool.
- **Tools**: Demonstrated capability to use tools (curl, yt-dlp binary) after a previous session where I apparently claimed to have none.
